# We're going to implement a cipher called the Folding Cipher. Why? Because it
# folds the alphabet in half and uses the adjacent letter.

# For example,
# a <=> z
# b <=> y
# c <=> x
# ...
# m <=> n

# Write a method, `digital_root(num)`. It should Sum the digits of a positive
# integer. If it is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number.
# Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the
# "digital root". **Do not use string conversion within your method.**
#
# You may wish to use a helper function, `digital_root_step(num)` which performs
# one step of the process.

# Jumble sort takes a string and an alphabet. It returns a copy of the string
# with the letters re-ordered according to their positions in the alphabet. If
# no alphabet is passed in, it defaults to normal alphabetical order (a-z).

# Example:
# jumble_sort("hello") => "ehllo"
# jumble_sort("hello", ['o', 'l', 'h', 'e']) => 'olleh'
